## About Me
I'm a 27-year-old currently undergoing a career transition into the field of application development. Around four months ago, I embarked on a journey to explore the world of programming, and it has been an exhilarating experience ever since.

## Skills and Focus
### HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
During the first weeks, which I dedicated to dive into **HTML and CSS**, I completed different courses like those provided by **FreeCodeCamp**. Rather than learning a new language, I decided to advance my knowledge regarding JavaScript and dive deeper into it.

## Future Plans
In the upcoming weeks, I plan to dive into learning **React** and a CSS framework such as **Bootstrap** or **Tailwind**. I'm excited to apply my newly acquired skills in my own first little projects.

## Projects and Approach
I have independently developed all the public projects on my profile from scratch on my own.
To realize those projects is a pleasure for me and helps me stay motivated and to carry on, because it shows how useful those programming skills are in daily or work life. 

## Contact and Collaboration
Thank you for visiting my profile and feel free to explore my projects. I'm always open to collaboration and continuous learning. Let's code and build something amazing together! If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out. Happy coding!
