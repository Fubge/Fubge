# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm a 27-year-old currently undergoing a career transition into the field of application development. Around four months ago, I embarked on a journey to explore the world of programming, and it has been an exhilarating experience ever since.

## Skills and Focus
### HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
During the first weeks, which I dedicated to dive into **HTML and CSS**, I completed different courses like those provided by **FreeCodeCamp**. I then delved into **JavaScript**. From there, I made the decision to focus on mastering JavaScript, prioritizing depth in a single language rather than a superficial understanding of multiple programming languages.

### Future Plans
In the coming weeks, I plan to dive into learning **React** and a CSS framework such as **Bootstrap** or **Tailwind**. I'm excited to undertake my first "real" projects, where I can apply my newly acquired skills.

## Projects and Approach
I want to emphasize that all the public projects on my profile have been developed from scratch, without tutorials or copying any code. The process of figuring out how to implement these projects has been a personal endeavor, helping me stay motivated and passionate about programming.

## Contact and Collaboration
Thank you for visiting my profile, and feel free to explore my projects. I'm always open to collaboration and continuous learning. Let's code and build something amazing together! If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out. Happy coding!
